<h2>How to</h2>
<p>You first need to upload the Data, there are two ways to do it :</p>
<ul>
<li>in the “Upload RDS file” tab, the app expects a .RDS file containg a <strong>RepSeqExperiment</strong> object,</li>
<li>in the “Upload text file(s)” tab, the app expects .tsv or .txt files containing Rep-Seq data from ClonotypeR or MiXCR, before uploading you will need to specify the origin of the data, the chain (<em>alpha</em> or <em>beta</em>) and provide a file containing informations about the samples. After a successful upload a RepSeqExperiment object is built, you then have the option to convert and download it as a .RDS file by clicking “Download RDS”.</li>
</ul>
