<h2>About</h2>
<p><strong>Shiny AnalyzAIRR</strong> is a MiAIRR compliant web application for the analysis of bulk Ig/TCR repertoire datasets.</p>
<ul>
<li>It proposes an analytical routine starting with data exploration, leading to in-depth statistical comparisons with the aim of answering defined biological questions</li>
<li>It allows the calculation of a set of diversity measures and statistical metrics applicable at any level of granularity</li>
<li>It offers different types of data visualization and ready-to-publish graphics</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p><strong>Shiny AnalyzAIRR</strong> proposes two different data loading processes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upload a <strong>RepSeqExperiment</strong> object generated using the <strong>AnalyzAIRR</strong> package</li>
<li>Upload alignment files (i) generated by one of the supported annotation tools, (ii) formatted following the MiAIRR standard guidelines from the AIRR Community, or (iii) following AnalyzAIRR format requirements.  Details on the latter format can be found here: . <br>
Only one chain can be loaded at once. <br>
It is possible to provide a metadata if users wish to perform inter-group comparative analyses. Sample names matching the alignment files must be in the first column. Any additional columns with relevant information for the analyses can be added thereafter.</li>
</ul>
Once files are succesfully downloaded, a RepSeqExperiment object is built which can downloaded in a rds format for subsequent usage.
